== Restricting storage locations

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a globally distributed event platform. When a client publishes a message, the platform stores the message on the nearest region to the publisher.
Sometimes regulations such as GDPR impose restrictions on where customer data can live. When using Micronaut integration you can
specify the endpoint of the topic so that Pub/Sub will persist the message data on the specified region.
To learn more about this feature visit the link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/resource-location-restriction[resource location restriction] page.

<1> The `endpoint` attribute enforces that messages sent via this method will be stored on the `europe-west1` region.

== Message ordering

Google Cloud Pub/Sub supports message ordering if messages are published to a single location, and specify an link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher#using_ordering_keys[ordering key].
An example of this would be trading orders placed for a specific symbol. If you use the symbol as the ordering key, all messages regardless of how many publishers are guaranteed to be delivered in order.

To enable message ordering for your publishers, use the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.OrderingKey[] in one of the method's arguments to declare it an ordering key.

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.ordering.OrderClient[tags="imports, clazz", source="main", project-base="doc-examples/example"]

<1> Ordering only works on regional endpoints, so you *must* declare an endpoint first
<2> Although the Pub/Sub API requires the key to be a String, the framework uses a conversion service to convert other types to String.

Here's an example of how to use ordering on your clients:

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.ordering.OrderService[tags="imports, clazz", source="main", project-base="doc-examples/example"]
