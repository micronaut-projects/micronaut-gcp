Google Cloud Pub/Sub has a local link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator#emulator_command-line_arguments[emulator] to enable developers to test their applications locally with no need to connect to the cloud Pub/Sub service.

The framework supports automatic switching of the `TransportChannelProvider` to use `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` if this variable is set on the environment.

NOTE: Make sure that you also set `GCP_PROJECT_ID` to be the same as the project you have configured the emulator to use. Otherwise the framework may pick up the projectId used by the default credentials.

You will need to manually configure topics and subscriptions on the emulator if you want to test locally. You can easily create resources using the link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest[Pub/Sub REST interface] to create topics and subscriptions.

For instance, the following `curl` command would create a topic named `micronaut-devices` on the `test-project` project.

```
curl -XPUT $PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST/v1/projects/test-project/topics/micronaut-devices
```
