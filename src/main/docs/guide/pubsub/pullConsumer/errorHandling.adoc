During message handling for listeners errors can happen at the framework or at your method level such as:

* Problems binding method arguments to the message body
* Content-Type deserialization issues
* Acknowledgement
* Uncaught exceptions at the annotated method

The framework provides a Global Error Handler api:exception.DefaultPubSubMessageReceiverExceptionHandler[], this handler will catch any errors and just log it. This behavior is far from ideal as messages would continue to be redelivered since they are not acknowledged.

There's two ways you can provide error handling.

* Locally: your ann:configuration.gcp.pubsub.annotation.PubSubListener[] class implements api:exception.PubSubMessageReceiverExceptionHandler[], then any error related to `Subscriptions` of that class will be handled by your class.
* Globally: You define a new implementation of api:exception.PubSubMessageReceiverExceptionHandler[] and annotate it as `@Primary` overriding the default one.

The api:exception.PubSubMessageReceiverException[] contains references to the originating bean that threw the exception as well as a reference to api:bind.PubSubConsumerState[] which has state information regarding the message handling.

<1> Implement `PubSubMessageReceiverExceptionHandler` to mark this bean as a local error handler
<2> Method invoked if any error happens during the processing of this `PubSubListener` class
<3> Reference to the class that originated the exception
<4> Contains information related to the subscription
<5> Depending on your use case you can `ack()` of `nack()` the message
