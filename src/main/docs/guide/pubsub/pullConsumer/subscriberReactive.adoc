In addition to byte[], PubsubMessage, and POJOs you can also define listener methods that receive a Reactive type such as a Reactor reactor:Mono[] or a RxJava rx:Single[]. The same deserialization rules as above will be applied using the type parameter of the Reactive type.

For the conversion to Reactive types to work correctly, you must add either the library https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-reactor/latest/guide/[Micronaut Reactor] or https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rxjava3/latest/guide/[Micronaut RxJava 3] to your application's dependencies.

For example, using Reactor:

.Using Reactive Types
snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.ReactiveSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main"]
<1> Bytes are copied and wrapped in a `Mono`, SerDes is bypassed, message id injected for usage
<2> SerDes is bypassed, `PubSubMessage` object is copied and wrapped in a `Mono`, no need to use `@MessageId`
<3> The framework will try to deserialize this payload into `Mono<Animal>`. If no `Content-Type` header is found, will default to `application/json`
<4> Uses a custom SerDes and the framework will find a api:serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[] that can handle `application/xml` and then pass the deserialized payload as `Mono<Animal>`.

Note that the above examples all return a `Mono<Object>` to allow for a fully non-blocking reactive message processing pipeline. When a `Publisher` is returned from a `@Subscription` method, it will be subscribed to by the framework and the message will not be auto-acknowledged until the `Publisher` completes successfully. If the `Publisher` completes with an error, the framework will `nack()` the message for re-delivery.
