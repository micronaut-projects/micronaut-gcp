=== Default Binding Functionality

Consumer argument binding is achieved through an link:{apimicronaut}core/bind/ArgumentBinderRegistry.html[ArgumentBinderRegistry]  that is specific for binding consumers from Pub/Sub messages.
The class responsible for this is the api:bind.PubSubBinderRegistry[].
The registry supports argument binders that are used based on an annotation applied to the argument or the argument type. All argument binders must implement either api:bind.PubSubAnnotatedArgumentBinder[] or api:bind.PubSubTypeArgumentBinder[].
The exception to that rule is the api:bind.PubSubDefaultArgumentBinder[] which is used when no other binders support a given argument.

When an argument needs bound, the api:bind.PubSubConsumerState[] is used as the source of all of the available data.
The binder registry follows a small sequence of steps to attempt to find a binder that supports the argument.

. Search the annotation based binders for one that matches any annotation on the argument that is annotated with link:{apimicronaut}core/bind/annotation/Bindable.html[@Bindable].
. Search the type based binders for one that matches or is a subclass of the argument type.
. Return the default binder.

=== Custom Binding

To inject your own argument binding behavior, it is as simple as registering a bean. The existing binder registry will inject it and include it in the normal processing.

==== Annotation Binding

A custom annotation can be created to bind consumer arguments. A custom binder can then be created to use that annotation and the api:bind.PubSubConsumerState[] to supply a value for the argument.
The value may in fact come from anywhere, however for the purposes of this documentation, we will show how you would create an annotation to bind the message publish time.

<1> The link:{apimicronaut}core/bind/annotation/Bindable.html[@Bindable] annotation is required for the annotation to be considered for binding.

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.bind.MessagePublishTimeAnnotationBinder[tags="imports, clazz", source="main", project-base="doc-examples/example"]

<1> The class is made a bean by annotating with `@Singleton`.
<2> The custom annotation is used as the generic type for the interface.
<3> The conversion service is injected into the instance.
<4> The message publish time is retrieved from the message state.
<5> The value is converted to the argument type. For example this allows the argument to be a `String` even though the epochMillis is a `Long`.

TIP: You could also return a `com.google.protobuf.Timestamp` if you register the appropriate type converter to the conversion service, but such example is outside of the scope of this documentation.

The annotation can now be used on the argument in a consumer method.

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.bind.CustomBindingSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main", project-base="doc-examples/example"]

<1> The message publish time will now be passed to the annotated argument
