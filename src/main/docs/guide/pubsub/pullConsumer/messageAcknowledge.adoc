When messages are delivered to ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] and ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods, they are by default auto-acknowledged to the PubSub service if the method returns without exceptions. When an error occurs during processing, a `nack` signal will be sent to the service instead, potentially resulting in redelivery of the message.

NOTE: See the section  <<errorHandling, Consumer ErrorHandling >> for more information on error handling.

NOTE: Google Cloud Pub/Sub controls delivery behavior in response to `nack` signals at the Subscription level, please refer to the link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber[Pub/Sub Subscriber documentation] for more information

It is possible to have manual acknowledgement control by adding an argument of type link:{apimicronaut}messaging/Acknowledgement.html[Acknowledgement] and manually invoking `ack()` or `nack()` methods..

TIP: If you provide an `Acknowledgement` type in your method and forget to invoke `ack()`/`nack()` the framework will log a warning message to let you know if you forgot to manually register an acknowledgement. Messages that are processed without an `ack` or `nack` signal being sent could potentially cause undesired behavior that could negatively affect performance.

The following example shows usage of manual acknowledgement:

.Manual Acknowledgement of Pull Messages
snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.AcknowledgementSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main"]

The following example shows usage of manual acknowledgement with push messages:

.Manual Acknowledgement of Push Messages
snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.AcknowledgementPushSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main"]
