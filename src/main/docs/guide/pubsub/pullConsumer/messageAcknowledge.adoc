The message delivery is handled by an `IntroductionAdvice` class api:intercept.PubSubConsumerAdvice[]. It invokes the method annotated with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[].
By default messages are auto acknowledged if the method returns without exceptions, see the section  <<erroHandling, Consumer ErrorHandling >> for more information on error handling.
It is possible to have manual acknowledgement control by adding an argument of type link:{apimicronaut}messaging/Acknowledge.html[Acknowledge] and manually invoking `ack()` or `nack()` methods.

Google Cloud Pub/Sub controls Acknowledgment at the Subscription level, please refer to the link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber[Pub/Sub Subscriber documentation] for more information.

TIP: If you provide an `Acknowledge` type in your method and forget to invoke `ack()`/`nack()` the framework will log a warning message to let you know if you forgot to manually register an acknowledgement.
