The framework provides a custom serialization/deserialization (SerDes) mechanism for both message producers and message listeners.
On the receiving end the rules to deserialize a link:https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/pubsub/v1/java/latest/com/google/api/services/pubsub/model/PubsubMessage.html[PubSubMessage] are the following:

. If the `body` argument of the method is of link:https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/pubsub/v1/java/latest/com/google/api/services/pubsub/model/PubsubMessage.html[PubSubMessage] type, SerDes is bypassed and the "raw" message is copied to the argument.
. If the `body` argument of the method is a byte array, SerDes is bypassed and the byte contents of the `PubSubMessage` are copied to the argument.
. If the `body` argument is a Pojo then the following applies:
.. The default `Content-Type` is `application/json` and the framework will use it if not overridden
.. If the message contains an attribute `Content-Type` that value is used
.. Finally if the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] or ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] has a `contentType` value this value overrides all of the previous values

Automatic SerDes is a nice feature that the framework offers, but sometimes you may need to have access to the `PubSubMessage` id.
This is provided via the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.MessageId[] annotation.
Once you annotate an argument of type `String` with this annotation, the message id will be copied to that argument.

IMPORTANT: PubSubMessage ids are always of type `String`, thus your annotated argument must also be a `String`.

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.ContentTypeSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main"]

<1> Bytes are copied, SerDes is bypassed, message id injected for usage
<2> SerDes is bypassed, `PubSubMessage` object is copied, no need to use `@MessageId`
<3> The framework will try to deserialize this payload. If no `Content-Type` header is found, will default to `application/json`
<4> Uses a custom SerDes and the framework will find a api:serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[] that can handle `application/xml`

Though the deserialization is identical for ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods, one thing that requires additional consideration is that since Push messages are delivered via HTTP the subscriber methods will be executed on the main HTTP event loop thread by default. Care must be taken not to block the event loop thread.

As a convenience, ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods that are known to use blocking operations during the course of message processing may be annotated with ann:io.micronaut.core.annotation.Blocking[]. This will cause the invocation of the method to occur in an separate thread provided by the `TaskExecutors.BLOCKING` `ExecutorService`.

If all of the subscriber methods in a given ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PubSubListener[] class are known to be blocking, then the ann:io.micronaut.core.annotation.Blocking[] annotation may be used at the class level instead and all ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods in that class will be executed by the `TaskExecutors.BLOCKING` `ExecutorService`.

NOTE: Since the methods are executed by the `TaskExecutors.BLOCKING` `ExecutorService`, Virtual Threads will be used if available.

The following example is equivalent to the preceding one, except using ann:io.micronaut.core.annotation.Blocking[] at the class level and ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods:

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.ContentTypePushSubscriber[tags="imports, clazz", source="main"]

<1> The class is annotated with ann:io.micronaut.core.annotation.Blocking[] so that all of the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PushSubscription[] methods will be executed on a separate thread
<2> Bytes are copied, SerDes is bypassed, message id injected for usage
<3> SerDes is bypassed, `PubSubMessage` object is copied, no need to use `@MessageId`
<4> The framework will try to deserialize this payload. If no `Content-Type` header is found, will default to `application/json`
<5> Uses a custom SerDes and the framework will find a api:serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[] that can handle `application/xml`
