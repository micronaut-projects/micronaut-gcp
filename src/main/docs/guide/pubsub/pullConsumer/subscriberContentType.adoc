The framework provides a custom serialization/deserialization (SerDes) mechanism for both message producers and message listeners.
On the receiving end the rules to deserialize a link:https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/pubsub/v1/java/latest/com/google/api/services/pubsub/model/PubsubMessage.html[PubSubMessage] are the following:

. If the `body` argument of the method is of link:https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/pubsub/v1/java/latest/com/google/api/services/pubsub/model/PubsubMessage.html[PubSubMessage] type, SerDes is bypassed and the "raw" message is copied to the argument.
. If the `body` argument of the method is a byte array, SerDes is bypassed and the byte contents of the `PubSubMessage` are copied to the argument.
. If the `body` argument is a Pojo then the following applies:
.. The default `Content-Type` is `application/json` and the framework will use it if not overridden
.. If the message contains an attribute `Content-Type` that value is used
.. Finally if the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] has a `contentType` value this value overrides all of the previous values

Automatic SerDes is a nice feature that the framework offers, but sometimes you may need to have access to the `PubSubMessage` id.
This is provided via the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.MessageId[] annotation.
Once you annotate an argument of type `String` with this annotation, the message id will be copied to that argument.

IMPORTANT: PubSubMessage ids are always of type `String` for that reason your annotated argument must also be a `String`.

<1> Bytes are copied, SerDes is bypassed, message id injected for usage
<2> SerDes is bypassed, `PubSubMessage` object is copied, no need to use `@MessageId`
<3> The framework will try to deserialize this payload. If no `Content-Type` header is found, will default to `application/json`
<4> Uses a custom SerDes and the framework will find a api:serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[] that can handle `application/xml`
