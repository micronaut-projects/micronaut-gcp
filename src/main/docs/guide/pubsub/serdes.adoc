The serialization and deserialization of message bodies is handled through instances of api:gcp.pubsub.serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[].
The ser-des (Serializer/Deserializer) is responsible for both serialization and deserialization of Pub/Sub message bodies into the message body types defined in your clients and consumers methods.

The ser-des are managed by a api:gcp.pubsub.serdes.PubSubMessageSerDesRegistry[].
All ser-des beans are injected in order into the registry and then searched for when serialization or deserialization is needed.
The search is based on the `Content-Type` defined for the message, the framework default is `application/json`.
If a ser-des can't be located an exception is thrown.
You can supply your own ser-des by simply registering a bean of type api:gcp.pubsub.serdes.PubSubMessageSerDes[].

For example let's say you want to implement a ser-des that uses java native object serialization instead of the Json serialization provided.
First you need to define a custom mimeType for that, we will use `application/x.java`, following the best principles for handling mime types.

NOTE: This is a fictional example, java serialization is not ideal, and its not portable.

<1> The class is declared as a singleton so it will be registered with the context
<2> The `contentType` defines what kind of messages will this implementation be able to handle

To publish messages with this ser-des set the Content-Type for `@Topic`
```java
@Topic(value = "animals", contentType = "application/x.java")
```

If the messages that are arriving on your subscriber already contain a `Content-Type` header with this type the framework will pick it up, or you can just force it on the `@Suibscription` annotation too.

```java
@Subscription(value = "animals", contentType = "application/x.java")
```
