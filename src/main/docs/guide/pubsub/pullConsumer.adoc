To start receiving messages you annotate a class with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PubSubListener[], the framework will then use AOP to deliver messages to methods annotated with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[].

== Subscriptions


All methods annotated with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] will be invoked by the framework.
Each annotated method creates an individual link:https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/com/google/cloud/pubsub/v1/Subscriber.html[Subscriber],
that can be configured using the `configuration` parameter of the ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] annotation.

IMPORTANT: Methods annotated with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] must be unique on your application.
If two distinct methods try to subscribe to the same `Subscription` an error is thrown.
This is intended to avoid issues with message Acknowledgement control.

IMPORTANT: The annotated method must have at least one argument that is bound to the body of the message or an exception is thrown.


== Resource naming

Just as described on the <<producer, Pub/Sub Publisher>> section, subscriptions examples are also using simple names such as `animals`.
Inside Google Cloud however resources are only accessible via their FQN. A Subscription name follows the pattern: `projects/$PROJECT_ID/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME`.
Micronaut integration with GCP will automatically grab the default project id available (please refer to the section <<setup, Google Project Id>> ) and convert the simple naming of the resource into a FQN.
You can also pass a FQN as the subscription name.
This is helpful when you need to listen to subscriptions from different projects.

<1> ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.PubSubListener[] marks this class to be a Message Listener
<2> Methods annotated with ann:gcp.pubsub.annotation.Subscription[] will receive messages from that subscription
<3> You can also use a FQN for the subscription, specially when you need to access a resource on a different project

NOTE: When publishing to a different project, make sure your service account has the proper access to the resource.
