Pub/Sub allows each link:https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/com/google/cloud/pubsub/v1/Publisher.html[Publisher] to have its own configuration for things such as executors or batching settings.
This is useful when you need to publish messages to topic that uses different SLAs.

The framework allows you to create configurations and then bind those configurations to each topic annotation using the `configuration` parameter.

.Configuration properties for api:configuration.PublisherConfigurationProperties[]
|===
Property,Type,Description
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.executor,java.lang.String,Name of the executor to use. Default: scheduled
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.total-timeout,org.threeten.bp.Duration,How long the logic should keep trying the remote calluntil it gives up completely. Default 600 seconds
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.initial-retry-delay,org.threeten.bp.Duration,Delay before the first retry. Default: 100ms
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.retry-delay-multiplier,double,Controls the change in retry delay. The retry delay of the previous call is multiplied by the RetryDelayMultiplier to calculate the retry delay for the next call. Default: 1.3
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.max-retry-delay,org.threeten.bp.Duration,"Puts a limit on the value of the retry delay, so that the RetryDelayMultiplier can't increase the retry delay higher than this amount. Default: 60 seconds"
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.max-attempts,int,Defines the maximum number of attempts to perform. Default: 0
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.jittered,boolean,Determines if the delay time should be randomized. Default: true
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.initial-rpc-timeout,org.threeten.bp.Duration,Controls the timeout for the initial RPC. Default: 5 seconds
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.rpc-timeout-multiplier,double,Controls the change in RPC timeout. The timeout of the previous call is multiplied by the RpcTimeoutMultiplier to calculate the timeout for the next call. Default: 1.0
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.retry.max-rpc-timeout,org.threeten.bp.Duration,"Puts a limit on the value of the RPC timeout, so that the RpcTimeoutMultiplier can't increase the RPC timeout higher than this amount. Default 0"
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.batching.element-count-threshold,java.lang.Long,"Set the element count threshold to use for batching. After this many elements are accumulated, they will be wrapped up in a batch and sent. Default: 100"
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.batching.request-byte-threshold,java.lang.Long,"Set the request byte threshold to use for batching. After this many bytes are accumulated, the elements will be wrapped up in a batch and sent. Default 1000 (1Kb)"
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.batching.delay-threshold,org.threeten.bp.Duration,"Set the delay threshold to use for batching. After this amount of time has elapsed (counting from the first element added), the elements will be wrapped up in a batch and sent. Default 1ms"
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.batching.is-enabled,java.lang.Boolean,Indicate if the batching is enabled. Default : true
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.flow-control.max-outstanding-element-count,java.lang.Long,Maximum number of outstanding elements to keep in memory before enforcing flow control.
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.flow-control.max-outstanding-request-bytes,java.lang.Long,Maximum number of outstanding bytes to keep in memory before enforcing flow control.
gcp.pubsub.publisher.*.flow-control.limit-exceeded-behavior,com.google.api.gax.batching.FlowController$LimitExceededBehavior,The behavior of  FlowController when the specified limits are exceeded. Defaults to Ignore.

For example suppose you have the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
gcp:
  pubsub:
    publisher:
      batching:
        executor: batch-executor
      immediate:
        executor: immediate-executor
        batching:
          enabled: false
----

You can then apply it to individual methods as:

snippet::io.micronaut.gcp.pubsub.publisher.CustomConfigurationClient[tags="imports, clazz", source="main", project-base="doc-examples/example"]

<1> The link:https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/com/google/cloud/pubsub/v1/Publisher.html[Publisher] will be configured using a configuration named `batching`
<2> The link:https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/com/google/cloud/pubsub/v1/Publisher.html[Publisher] will be configured using a configuration named `immediate`

IMPORTANT: `FlowControlSettings` are actually configured for the `BatchingSettings` property, due the nature of Google's Builders the configuration was
flattened at `PubSubConfigurationProperties` level, and it's injected it into the `RetrySettings` later.
