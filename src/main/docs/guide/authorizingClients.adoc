The `micronaut-gcp-http-client` module can be used to help authorize service-to-service communication. To get started add the following module:

dependency:io.micronaut.gcp:micronaut-gcp-http-client[]

You should then configure the service accounts as per the https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/service-to-service[documentation on service-to-service] communication and the enable the filter for the outgoing URI paths you wish to include the Google-signed OAuth ID token:
